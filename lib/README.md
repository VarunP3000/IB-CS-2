This is my IB CS IA from when I was in IB CS HL 1 in 11th grade.
The purpose of this project was to create an application that authenticated users and uploaded and retrieved their data from a database on Android Firebase.
This project gave me an insight on how applications were developed and tested my problem solving skills and my knowledge of Programming concepts such as Object
Oriented Programming, and how to build an efficient UI that could carry out the functionality of my code.
